In this project, as a django learner, I create a basic website under the instruction of the book "Django 2 by Example". I create some apps, consisting of "account", 
which manage different users to log in or log out or reset password, "shop", which shows the shopping product to users, "cart" and "order", respectively helping users
add the product to the cart and submit the order when they want to buy the products in cart.

You can read the file "final result" if you just want to directly see the interface of this website.
